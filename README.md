# Data-Visualization
Project dedicated to explore data through visual representations, by using different tools that python offer us. The goal of this project is to demonstrate that when a representation of a data set is simple and visually appealing, its meaning becomes so clear to viewers that they can see patterns in the data sets that they never knew existed.
